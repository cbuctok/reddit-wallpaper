# reddit-wallpaper
This script automatically sets a random image from one of the subreddits: r/wallpapers, r/art, r/iwallpaper.

-d set storage directory

Bad example, but works:
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbuctok/reddit-wallpaper/multisub/wallpaper.sh | bash -s -- -d /home/$USER/Pictures/Wallpapers/
```
